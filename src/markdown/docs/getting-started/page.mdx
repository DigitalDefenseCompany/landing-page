## Getting Started

VeriGood.ai is a GitHub app that integrates with an existing blockchain codebase built on Foundry. Support for other frameworks like Hardhat and Solana is coming soon.

It automatically adds the GitHub action workflow, uses AI to generate the specs, and runs formal verification tests over it.
